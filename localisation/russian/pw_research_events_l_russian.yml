    pw_research.1000.desc: "[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]! It is our understanding that your people have constructed a peculiar device on [PWFallenEmpirePCPlanet.GetName]. A Collider you call it. It is a collider indeed, but not as you seem to believe... it matters not now, you will understand in time. We come for different matters.\n\nI represent a group of distinguish theologians that believe this collider-device could be of great use to us. We require use of the entire facility for spiritual meditation, as it is uniquely able to provide contemplation into certain aspects of our reality and beyond. You do not need to know the specifics, just that we will require the space for §Y6 months§!.\n\nA modest request. If you agree we can start as soon as possible."
    pw_research.1000.a: "By all means, the Supercollider is yours."
    pw_research.1000.b: "Why do you require our facilities for this?"
    pw_research.1000.c: "The $pw_building_particle_supercollider$ is not for such uses."
    pw_research.1001.name: "§H[PWFallenEmpirePC.GetName]§!: A Matter of Faith"
    pw_research.1001.desc: "This particular matter is a conundrum for us. Our group has been granted permission to investigate these divine subjects by meditating trough a material conduit, however this procedure is considered taboo in our society. We need a proper conduit in a foreign empire.\nAny data this meditation yields will remain in your records, if it does not expose our secrets.\n\nWe promise that your planet is will not suffer any harm."
    pw_research.1001.a: "Very well, your group may use the Supercollider."
    pw_research.1002.name: "§H[PWFallenEmpirePC.GetName]§!: A Matter of Faith"
    pw_research.1002.desc: "Marvelous!\n\nOur acolytes are already on route.\nMake sure they are not disturbed during their meditation."
    pw_research.1002.a: "They will not."
    pw_research.1003.name: "§H[PWFallenEmpirePC.GetName]§!: A Matter of Faith"
    pw_research.1003.desc: "Such a shame.\n\n§H[PWFallenEmpirePC.GetAdj]§! will not be happy with this decision."
    pw_research.1003.a: "Terminate Communications."
    pw_research.1004.name: "The Call of War"
    pw_research.1004.desc: "As the news of war reach our country, we checked on the group sent by the [PWFallenEmpirePC.GetName] only to find that they have completely vanished!\n\nWe must assume that they have returned to their country because of the current conflict, but no traces of them remain."
    pw_research.1004.a: "At least we have our research back."
    pw_research.1005.name: "Energy Drain"
    pw_research.1005.desc: "Sudden energy fluctuations has drained many of our reserves on [PWFallenEmpirePC.GetName]. Fortunately, no critical system were permanently damaged.\n\nReports point to the $pw_particle_supercollider$ as the epicenter of these fluctuations. It must have something to do with the group of theologians from §H[PWFallenEmpirePC.GetName]§! and their meditation there."
    pw_research.1005.a: "Contact them!"
    pw_research.1005.b: "We must not disturb the theologians."
    pw_research.1006.name: "§H[PWFallenEmpirePC.GetName]§!: Energy Drain"
    pw_research.1006.desc: "[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural], do not disturb the theologians while they work!\n\nIf you are contacting us about the energetic anomalies, understand that they are expected and pose no danger; in fact, you should see them as a blessing, a glimpse at higher existence that few are able to gaze.\n\nThese fluctuations will dissipate in time, have faith."
    pw_research.1006.a: "Continue, then."
    pw_research.1006.b: "Unacceptable, the group must leave now."
    pw_research.1007.name: "§H[PWFallenEmpirePC.GetName]§!: Energy Drain"

    pw_research.1008.desc: "A shame, but we have what we came for.\nWe will leave now.\nNo data will remain for your researchers."
    pw_research.1008.a: "Good riddance."
    pw_research.1009.name: "§H[PWFallenEmpirePC.GetName]§! Gratitude"
    pw_research.1009.desc: "[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural], the theologians have concluded their work and have been blessed with the divine knowledge they sought.\n\nWe left much data for your researchers to analyse, and hope that it will illuminate your path.\nYou have our thanks."
    pw_research.1009.a: "We hope it was worth the effort."
    pw_research.2000.name: "§H[PWFallenEmpireDC.GetName]§!: Under Our Dome"
    pw_research.2000.desc: "Noble [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural], we constantly monitor the galaxy in search of new species that need top be conserved, and it has not escaped our sight that you have constructed a preserve of your own.\nWe congratulate you.\n\nEven tough, as we understand it, this domed reserve will not be directed to the preservation of living specimens, but for societal experiments, we would like to establish our own surveillance and sensory equipment inside the Dome.\n\nThe process will not take more than §Y6 months§!. Besides, we care not for you experimental data or methods, these can remain in secrecy."
    pw_research.2000.a: "Install what equipment you must."
    pw_research.2000.b: "Exactly what information will you be gathering?"
    pw_research.2000.c: "What happens in the $pw_building_domed_city$ stays there."
    pw_research.2001.name: "§H[PWFallenEmpireDC.GetName]§!: Under Our Dome"
    pw_research.2001.desc: "You see, life in this galaxy is diverse and exotic and our Xeno-Keepers can only predict so much of it. There are lifeforms roaming our worlds beyond your wildest dreams. And all of them require care, some more special attention than others.\n\nWhat we require is more data to perfect our containment procedures. We have agreed that our imagination is limited, but lesser empires such as yours have always had a peculiar creativity. In many ways, we would like to examine that ingenuity.\n\nAs we have stated, none of your experimentation methods concern us, your science is too simple to be stolen. We are looking for other kinds of information.\nAnd in the end, who knows what insights might your scientists have from the data we collect? We could even share some valuable techniques."
    pw_research.2001.a: "Very well, if it helps our experiments, go ahead."
    pw_research.2002.name: "§H[PWFallenEmpireDC.GetName]§!: Under Our Dome"
    pw_research.2002.desc: "Perfect!\n\nYou have no idea how many species this has the potential to assist."
    pw_research.2002.a: "We are content to boost our research."

    pw_research.2005.name: "Intergalactic Transmission"
    pw_research.2005.desc: "We re receiving reports from all around the galaxy that footage from inside our $pw_domed_city$ was temporarily transmitted in several wavelengths, reaching the whole galaxy. Some of those transmissions have managed to find their way into secured channels, threatening the national security of several states. The rogue transmissions have ceased for the time being, but our envoys will surely have diplomatic issues to handle.\n\nInternal investigations are already underway, but initial reports point to [PWFallenEmpireDC.GetAdj] interference in our system as the primary cause. We know they wanted surveillance data, but distributing classified information is too much."
    pw_research.2005.a: "Contact them!"
    pw_research.2005.b: "Dismiss it all as a joke."
    pw_research.2006.name: "§H[PWFallenEmpireDC.GetName]§!: Intergalactic Transmission"
    pw_research.2006.desc: "Hello again, [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]!\n\nThe transmission you ask?\nYes, preliminary tests are promising!\n\nWhat do you mean the whole galaxy?!\n\nNo, I assure you it was not our intention. We were simply attempting to synchronize communication with our own frequencies. It is clearly a minor mistake that will not repeat itself, if you only let us continue with our work."
    pw_research.2006.a: "You may continue, but no more mistakes."
    pw_research.2006.b: "Unacceptable, take your equipment and leave."
    pw_research.2007.name: "§H[PWFallenEmpireDC.GetName]§!: Intergalactic Transmission"
    pw_research.2007.desc: "Fantastic!\n\nI am sure you will come around to see this experience as an opportunity, actually.\nBut let us go back to work."
    pw_research.2007.a: "An opportunity? Never mind..."

    pw_research.2008.desc: "We should have known.\nYour species does have a tendency towards egotism.\n\nSo much work gone to waste and so much data that we will not have, but alas, we will leave you alone."
    pw_research.2008.a: "Good riddance."
    pw_research.2009.name: "§H[PWFallenEmpireDC.GetName]§! Gratitude"
    pw_research.2009.desc: "[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural], everything we needed to install is in place, you can have you research dome back.\n\nAs promised, and as recompensation for that small diplomatic incident, we have registered several procedures that your researchers can follow to both study and keep contained populations under control. We have left enough that your scientist can develop their own methods.\n\nWe are eager to watch new containment mechanisms develop under your management of the $pw_building_domed_city$."
    pw_research.2009.a: "So are we to see new societal developments."
    pw_research.3000.name: "§H[PWFallenEmpireACTS.GetName]§!: Immovable and Unstoppable"
    pw_research.3000.desc: "[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural], there is a matter that your kind can be of assistance to us.\n\nTwo of the most brilliant minds of our country have engaged in a feud for the past year, concerning a theoretical problem, that has divide our society. Discussion around this problem has formulated and discarded numerous hypothesis, generated countless simulations and spawned many practical models. All leaving us with the same conclusion: Undeterminable.\n\nHowever, we could not help but notice that your empire has constructed a proper test site for this kind of thing on [PWFallenEmpireACTSPlanet.GetName], an Abyssal Crater for experiments. We require access to the facility for §Y6 months§! to conclude our experiments and put an end to this division.\n\nOf course, your researchers can have every record of this experiment. \nMaybe they will learn a thing or two."
    pw_research.3000.a: "You can use the Abyssal Crater for your tests."
    pw_research.3000.b: "In what exactly consists this... experiment?"
    pw_research.3000.c: "Let you close to where we test our weapons? Out of the question."
    pw_research.3001.name: "§H[PWFallenEmpireACTS.GetName]§!: Immovable and Unstoppable"
    pw_research.3001.desc: "Oh, the experiment, yes.\n\nThe formulation of the problem is quite simple really: \"what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object?\"\n\nThat proposition is silly, of course, an immovable object would produce an unstoppable force of its own, it is more a question of semantics than physics. But, the discussion around this problem escalated, and had two our our most renowned engineers engaged in an academic battle. The first was sure that they could build a weapon able to destroy anything with a single blow, while the second was sure they could project a structure that could survive a single shot from any armament.\n\nI am sure you can see why we need a proper place to test the constructed prototypes. We can't risk any of our own planets...\nBut we are sure your Test Site will be fine!"
    pw_research.3001.a: "Sure, if we can have data on these prototype."
    pw_research.3002.name: "§H[PWFallenEmpireACTS.GetName]§!: Immovable and Unstoppable"
    pw_research.3002.desc: "Fantastic!\n\nEngineers and technicians are already arriving with the necessary equipment as we speak.\n\nYou might want to evacuate the area surrounding the $pw_building_abyssal_crater_test_site$.\n\nTemporarily, of course."
    pw_research.3002.a: "Of course..."
    pw_research.3003.name: "§H[PWFallenEmpireACTS.GetName]§!: Immovable and Unstoppable"
    pw_research.3003.desc: "Why must you kind insist in hamper the progress of science?\n\nIt does not matter, if you will not have us, we will find a less optimal place to conduct our tests."
    pw_research.3003.a: "As long as it is not close to our research."
    pw_research.3004.name: "The Call of War"

    pw_research.3005.desc: "Grave tremors afflict the surface of [PWFallenEmpireACTSPlanet.GetName]. Reports indicate that many urban areas are experiencing earthquakes and small settlements have been destroyed. They also point that a particular volatile experiment on the $pw_abyssal_crater_test_site$ has been conducted right before ths devastation was reported.\n\nThis has something to do with the [PWFallenEmpireACTS.GetName], but their researchers assure us that it was only a small calibration error and will not happen again."
    pw_research.3005.a: "Contact them!"
    pw_research.3005.b: "Par for the course, no need for panic."

    pw_research.3006.desc: "The explosions?\n\nYes, as our experts have pointed out it is a small mistake. It happens when we are dealing with such marvels of engineering.\n\nRest assured that it will not repeat itself again. A new calibration team is already on their way to assist further experiments.\n\nA small incident like this should not stand in the way of discovery, don't you think?"
    pw_research.3006.a: "Continue, then."
    pw_research.3006.b: "Unacceptable, the experiments must stop now."
    pw_research.3007.name: "§H[PWFallenEmpireACTS.GetName]§!: Blows of Devastation"

    pw_research.3008.desc: "What? Leave? For such a puny mishap?\n\nVery well, we will take our massive weapon of destruction and the only protection against it to an uninhabitable planet for further testing.\n\nAlso, every data of the experiments already conducted has been expunged from your records.\n\nOur team is on its way out."

    pw_research.3009.desc: "[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural], we have good and bad news!\n\nThe good news is that we have concluded our experiments and are ready to hand the data over to your scientists, we will be leaving shortly after. The bad news is that, for our purposes, very little could be determined from this data.\nBoth of the prototypes have mutually destroyed themselves and spawned new technical and semantical arguments. It seems this will not be the end of it, but we do have a long time to argue.\n\nAlso, it appears that our testing has excavated some minerals from the depths of your crater, as they have little value to us, you might as well have them, as a form of gratitude.\n\nKeep at it and your kind may be able to solve some of the mysteries of the universe.\nPerhaps the simplest ones."

First proposed as a joke, it has gained some traction and has reached important communicators of our country.\n\nWe could transmit the edited footage of experiments in the $pw_building_domed_city$ as a hyper-reality media show. A charismatic host, experiments disguised as competitions, cameras everywhere, the infrastructure is basically in place.\n\nMedia experts assure us that it would be a massive success across the galaxy and it would not interfere at all with the research operation of the facility.\nUnless we were open to the idea of viewer interactivity..."
