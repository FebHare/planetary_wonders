Because of the way it was built, each inmate can never be sure when they are being watched, but the possibility that they are, dissimulates any deviant behavior. The fear of punishment becomes the punishment itself and lack of compliancy is inhibited.\nThis concept can be expanded to every criminal in potential, the so called population, by the implementation of a peculiar moral vigilance system in which anyone else could be a potential informer. That is what we call the Panspectron: everyone will watch over everyone else - and themselves - influenced by a carefully curated artificial moral code that prioritizes the maintenance of the status quo.
