    #Complete Space Elevator message
    pw_message_space_elevator_complete: "§MSpace Elevator§! has been constructed in $PLANET|Y$."
    #First Time Complete Space Elevator
    pw_complete.101.name: "To The Stars We Rise"
    pw_complete.101.desc: "A great spire launches for the clouds of [ROOT.GetName] ending only on its outer atmosphere. Already the platforms of our recently built Space Elevator run up and down, carrying immigrants and emigrants; exports and imports.\nThe city sized launch complex provides a variety of jobs in transportation and logistics, but it also caries some concern on the surveillance of our planet borders.\n\nNevertheless it stands a planetary monument."
    pw_complete.101.a: "We welcome the galaxy here!"
    pw_complete.101.b: "Increase migration checks, just to to be sure."

    #Complete Particle Supercollider
    pw_message_particle_supercollider_complete: "§MParticle Supercollider§! has been constructed in $PLANET|Y$."
    #First Time Complete Particle Supercollider
    pw_complete.201.name: "Accelerating Forward"
    pw_complete.201.desc: "A myriad of experiments proposals has arrived at [ROOT.GetName] on the last fez months as the entire scientific community yearns to to see what this newly built Particle Supercollider can reveal.\nSpanning a circumference that could encompass our largest cities and draining twice as much power, the Supercollider is capable of positron collisions never before observed in controlled experiments and more importantly, it is capable of putting the most delirious theories of field manipulation, quantum entanglements and rope theory to the test.\n\nWho knows what lurks behind the veil of theory?"
    pw_complete.201.a: "Let us peek behind the curtains of space and time."
    pw_complete.201.b: "Whatever it is we are destined to find it."

    #Complete Domed City
    pw_message_domed_city_complete: "§MDomed City§! has been constructed in $PLANET|Y$."
    #First Time Complete Domed City
    pw_complete.301.name: "Isolation Experiments"
    pw_complete.301.desc: "A city district of [ROOT.GetName], completely secluded behind a holographic dome and protected by a powerful force field. It is finally complete.\nUtilizing hundreds of thousands of sensor, cameras and actuators our scientists can elaborate many different societal experiments at a city scale. This alone can advance our understanding of societal mechanism and statecraft by years.Topics such as democracy, autocracy, technocracy, cooperation, competition, segregation, extreme or flat hierarchies and more can be explored without moral boundaries from the outside world, not to mention the examination of applying chemical, physical ou psychological stimulus in these communities.\n\nWe can finally have systematic testing to things we could only look back to observe."
    pw_complete.301.a: "Start recruiting volunteers."
    pw_complete.301.b: "Rally the subjects."

    #Complete Abyssal Crater Test Site
    pw_message_abyssal_crater_test_site_complete: "§MAbyssal Crater Test Site§! has been constructed in $PLANET|Y$."
    #First Time Complete Abyssal Crater Test Site
    pw_complete.401.name: "Between Haven and Earth"
    pw_complete.401.desc: "After many months of work we have established a convenient pit in the surface of [ROOT.GetName] and already our testing site there can be inaugurated along side its sister site, a small orbital station that remains constantly in the zenith of the crater.\nThis area is reserved for extreme conditions engineering testing such as orbital missile propulsion, high gravity spacecraft launches and material resistance to explosion and piercing damage. The orbital sister site presents many new opportunities to test spatial to ground and ground to space targeting.\nWe can also take advantage of the massive height difference to experiment with a variety of building patterns that range from micro to macro gravity and pressure conditions.\n\nCertainly our offensive and defensive capabilities will benefit from bombarding an abyss, if only we can spare extra alloys for the tests."
    pw_complete.401.a: "The galaxy is dark and full of enemies, we should be prepared even if we wont use it."
    pw_complete.401.b: "It will be good to know the extend of the damage we can cause."

    #Complete Erebus Project
    pw_message_erebus_project_complete: "§MErebus Project§! has been constructed in $PLANET|Y$."
    #First Time Complete Erebus Project
    pw_complete.501.name: "Down in the deep of [ROOT.GetName]"
    pw_complete.501.desc: "The tunnels are secured and excavated, the terrain has been prospected the equipment is prepared; we are ready to start exploiting the bowels of [ROOT.GetName] in search of valuable and constantly needed minerals.\nThe Erebus Project now offers a multitude of tunnels and passageways deep in the underground of the planet, all populated with the infrastructure and materials needed for the extraction and transportation of mineral resources: from common rock to rare ore. New storage facilities in the surface were also installed to deal with the increase in production.\n\nWe have ventured deep into space, now it is time to venture equally deep into the earth."
    pw_complete.501.a: "The minerals must flow."

    #Complete Helios Tower
    pw_message_erebus_project_complete: "§MHelios Tower§! has been constructed in $PLANET|Y$."
    #First Time Complete Helios Tower
    pw_complete.601.name: "A Blazing Spire Is Born"
    pw_complete.601.desc: "A field the size of a city of automated mirror arrays calibrated to converge a chunk of the energy of [ROOT.GetStarName] that hits the surface of [ROOT.GetName] to a central spire. The Helios Tower possess the most advanced energy conversion technology and is now ready to supplement any of our country's need for power.\n\nPerhaps we could also iterate on the design and maybe even trap a star in the future"
    pw_complete.601.a: "Brilliant!"
