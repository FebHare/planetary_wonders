    pw_site_drained_paradise: "Drained Paradise"
    pw_site_drained_paradise_desc: "Readings suggest that [From.Planet.GetName] was habitable at some point in its history. Not only that, the composition of the ground, orbital position and presence of water show that the planet could have had a thriving ecosystem, lush green fields, abundance of minerals and a paradisiacal atmosphere. What could have happened to deprive this planet of life?\n\nThere are many signals of ruined buildings also present in the surface, three of which draw the most attention because of their size and key position. Maybe they hold the secret of this planet's past."
    pw_archaeology.105.name: "Empty Cornucopia"
    pw_archaeology.105.desc: "The first of these grand ruins consist of an abandoned genetic laboratory isolated from other ruins. Surrounding soil readings suggest a great diversity of nutrients used to compose the ground here and points to a planet containing a myriad of environments that housed diverse plant, animal and fungi life. One of the better preserved walls of the building revel the drawing of a cornucopia, and it seems that this was food growing and collection center in a distant past. Further analysis shows that this was the epicenter of total ecological collapse of the planet's biosphere, due to predatory harvesting practices."
    pw_archaeology.110.name: "Exhausted Tower"
    pw_archaeology.110.desc: "The second ruined location appears to be a grand solar structure of some sort, that used to consist of a heliostat with several mirror arrays pointing to a central spire that converted the captured solar energy to another form, which we could not determine. The entire structure seem to have been able to float freely following the star's zenith to maximize energy intake, but has crashed a long time ago from lack of maintenance. In proximity to the crash site, our archeologists have found the control facility of this wonderful structure, which contains records telling how the original builders were able to manipulate the atmosphere of [From.Planet.GetName], to clear the clouds for the heliostat and exploit the rain in hydropower reservoirs. The constant seeding and voiding of clouds has shredded the atmosphere of the planet to the point of catastrophe."
    pw_archaeology.115.name: "Drained Rock"
    pw_archaeology.115.desc: "The third ruin is the entrance of a gigantic mining project that permeates the entire surface of [From.Planet.GetName]. Old machinery and tools here indicate a massive scale prospecting and extraction enterprise of valuable minerals of many types and uses. Unfortunately, the archaeological team also found several reports of soil erosion and land degradation caused by this excavation, and evidence that those reports were solemnly ignored; the final nail on this planets coffin.\n\nAll is not lost, however, with the data we have collected from these sites, and the employment of our own technology and resources, the science team here is fairly confident that they can bring this planet back to its verdant glory, using the established infrastructure. First we must revert the erosion processes and bring nutrients back to the ground by utilizing our own minerals."
    pw_archaeology.115.a: "Use the minerals, start the renewal process."
    pw_archaeology.120.name: "A Ground to Walk Upon"
    pw_archaeology.120.desc: "By adapting some of the old digging machines of the mining project we could rebuild the soil components and mend the earth, bringing tectonic stability and mineral nutrition back to most of the surface of [From.Planet.GetName]. Care was taken to retain some of these extracting facilities for future use, provided we do not drain the minerals from the planet once again. This paves the way to revitalizing the biosphere, but is only the first step.\n\nNow the science team gaze upwards, to the atmosphere, for we must use our energy to reestablish the original gasses and jump start the water cycle."
    pw_archaeology.125.name: "A Sky Over Our Heads"
    pw_archaeology.125.desc: "Utilizing the ancient cloud manipulation facility of the heliostat, the science tem in [From.Planet.GetName] was able to revert its damaging process and refill the atmosphere with gases that will help with the settlement of life in the planet. While not entirely breathable, the newly established atmosphere is already balancing the planet temperature, protecting the surface from space radiation and waiting to receive gas exchange from life forms.\n\nThe terraforming process is almost complete, now we only need to reintroduce a stable ecosystem to harmonious maintain the achieved planetary balance."
    pw_archaeology.125.a: "We will provide the nutrients to finish the process."
    pw_archaeology.125.b: "We will provide the resources to finish the process."
    pw_archaeology.130.name: "Life All Around"
    pw_archaeology.130.desc: "Using the provided resources and the facilities in the abandoned cornucopia the science team has manage to revitalize the broken biosphere of [From.Planet.GetName] and reignite the vital force there. By using recovered data, we could stabilize gas exchange and food chains much faster than natural phenomenons. Finally, our scientists could breath the fresh air of the planet for the first time.\n\n[From.Planet.GetName] now blossoms with new life and proper colonization of the planet can be underway. The only caveat is that the ecosystem of the planet - the soil, the atmosphere and the living organisms - is in an unstable balance and can never recover completely, thus the ancient structures that drained the planetary living energy cannot be rebuild, but they can still serve us as they are."

    pw_site_lunar_archive: "Lunar Archive"
    pw_site_lunar_archive_desc: "There is considerable evidence of alien activity inside this moon.\n\nInitial reports suggest that this natural satellite was completely excavated and an extensive structure of unknown purpose was constructed inside. The science team speculates that this lunar complex was build by the inhabitants of the orbiting planet with advanced techniques, but could not discern its function."
    pw_archaeology.205.name: "Museum of Particles"
    pw_archaeology.205.desc: "Gaining entrance into the lunar complex was a relatively easy task, it seams that the structure was designed to be accessible and inviting. Inside, the archaeology team quickly noticed that the complex is divided in distinct sections, designated as collections and began exploring one of these chambers.\n\nThe first collection the team found presented itself as \"The Assemblage of Every Known Particle\", of which only vestiges remain. However, evidence found does suggest some great technological and power investment in maintaining a diverse collection of particles stable and in display, alongside heaps of experimental data on this field of physics. If these are to be believed, this civilization was able to maintain in stasis some elements we could only observe in the birth of stars!"
    pw_archaeology.210.name: "Library of Babel"
    pw_archaeology.210.desc: "The second collection housed in this lunar complex reveled a deep preoccupation with history and the preservation of knowledge shared by the civilization that constructed this place. It consist in a repository of non-digital data, such as alien books, maps, sound and image recordings and physical models of every kind. The collection spans several floors and will require a permanent research station in order analyze everything.\n\nWhile it is unclear if this collection served as a simple preservation of the past, or an active source of historiographical studies, it has become evident that there is a lot here to help us understand this ancient culture."
    pw_archaeology.215.name: "Mechanical Collection"
    pw_archaeology.215.desc: "As the team reaches the third collection, the purpose of this whole complex becomes more apparent. Seemingly, the moon was converted into a repository of information indistinct of area of knowledge, that was able to hold everything that civilization would produce or research.\n\nThe collection in question seems to have been constructed to hold every kind engineering model conceived, from the most simple to the utterly complex. Data from this assortment is already being transferred to our researchers in order to compare with our own mechanical evolution. While there are many insights we can draw from these designs, it is no surprise that such an advanced technology was required to construct a place like this."
    pw_archaeology.220.name: "Cradle of Worlds"
    pw_archaeology.220.desc: "The team investigating what is now known as The Lunar Archive, has come across the caveats of such a bold project: maintenance. It seems that centuries without the caretaking of diligent archivists have render most of the collections fruitless.\n\nAfter investigating many empty chambers, the archaeology team had exciting news about their findings: a collection of habitable planets. At least, what is left of an assortment of models detailing habitable conditions in galactic bodies. Most of the models have crumbled to dust, but one drew special interest: it is an almost perfect match to a planet in this system we have deemed uninhabitable. Our scientists are already reviewing the data, but it seems that the planet indeed held life at some point in its history, and more importantly, we may have the key to reviving it once again."
    pw_archaeology.225.name: "The Archive of Archives"
    pw_archaeology.225.desc: "Finally, the excavating team has reached the operational center of the Lunar Archive. They have found a marvel of documentation, an Archive of Archives. This center acts as the index of all the other collections, utilizing a surprisingly intuitive organization system, and remains the most preserved chamber of the complex.\n\nHere a permanent research station can be established, aiding any ongoing research on the orbiting planet. And, as it was designed, the Lunar Archive shall be open for all scholars who wish to research the vast repository of knowledge it provides."
    pw_archaeology.230.name: "A Grand Archive"
    pw_archaeology.230.desc: "After the recent excavation of the Lunar Archive, our intellectual circles have been discussing the possibility of organizing such project for own culture: a place where we can catalogue and analyze our history, without immaterial speculation.\n\nAfter all, We have gathered many of the techniques that could be employed in this enterprise. We would simply have to collect the contents of this massive archive."
    pw_archaeology.230.a: "A logical project for our future."
    pw_archaeology.230.b: "Our research requires no such gimmicks."
