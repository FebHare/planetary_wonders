    PW_LIBRARY_OF_BABEL_DESC: "Man in our population argue that the memory and culture of our country lives among al of its non-digital artifacts, such as books, paintings and toys. Such cultural artifacts have ever lived scattered, in galleries and museum, or hidden in lost attics. All of those and even beyond shall be gathered for the Library of Babel."
