    #Complete Space Elevator message
    pw_message_space_elevator_complete: "§MSpace Elevator§! has been constructed in $PLANET|Y$."
    #First Time Complete Space Elevator
    pw_complete.101.name: "To The Stars We Rise"
    pw_complete.101.desc: "A great spire launches for the clouds of [ROOT.GetName] ending only on its outer atmosphere. Already the platforms of our recently built Space Elevator run up and down, carrying immigrants and emigrants; exports and imports.\nThe city sized launch complex provides a variety of jobs in transportation and logistics, but it also caries some concern on the surveillance of our planet borders.\n\nNevertheless it stands a planetary monument."
    pw_complete.101.a: "marvelous!"

    #Complete Particle Supercollider
    pw_message_particle_supercollider_complete: "§MParticle Supercollider§! has been constructed in $PLANET|Y$."
    #First Time Complete Particle Supercollider
    pw_complete.201.name: "Accelerating Forward"
    pw_complete.201.desc: "A myriad of experiments proposals has arrived at [ROOT.GetName] on the last fez months as the entire scientific community yearns to to see what this newly built Particle Supercollider can reveal.\nSpanning a circumference that could encompass our largest cities and draining twice as much power, the Supercollider is capable of positron collisions never before observed in controlled experiments and more importantly, it is capable of putting the most delirious theories of field manipulation, quantum entanglements and rope theory to the test.\n\nWho knows what lurks behind the veil of theory?"
    pw_complete.201.a: "Let us peek behind the curtains of space and time."

    #Complete Domed City
    pw_message_domed_city_complete: "§MDomed City§! has been constructed in $PLANET|Y$."
    #First Time Complete Domed City
    pw_complete.301.name: "Isolation Experiments"
    pw_complete.301.desc: "A city district of [ROOT.GetName], completely secluded behind a holographic dome and protected by a powerful force field. It is finally complete.\nUtilizing hundreds of thousands of sensor, cameras and actuators our scientists can elaborate many different societal experiments at a city scale. This alone can advance our understanding of societal mechanism and statecraft by years.Topics such as democracy, autocracy, technocracy, cooperation, competition, segregation, extreme or flat hierarchies and more can be explored without moral boundaries from the outside world, not to mention the examination of applying chemical, physical ou psychological stimulus in these communities.\n\nWe can finally have systematic testing to things we could only look back to observe."
    pw_complete.301.a: "Start recruiting volunteers."
    pw_complete.301.b: "Rally the subjects."
