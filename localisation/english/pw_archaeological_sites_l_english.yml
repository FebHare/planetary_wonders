    ## Archaeology: Drained Paradise.
    #Site Intro
    pw_site_drained_paradise: "Drained Paradise"
    pw_site_drained_paradise_desc: "Readings suggest that [From.Planet.GetName] was habitable at some point in its history. Not only that, the composition of the ground, orbital position and presence of water show that the planet could have had a thriving ecosystem, lush green fields, abundance of minerals and a paradisiacal atmosphere. What could have happened to deprive this planet of life?\n\nThere are many signals of ruined buildings also present in the surface, three of which draw the most attention because of their size and key position. Maybe they hold the secret of this planet's past."
    #Stage 1 - Demetrius Cornucopia
    pw_archaeology.105.name: "Empty Cornucopia"
    pw_archaeology.105.desc: "The first of these grand ruins consist of an abandoned genetic laboratory isolated from other ruins. Surrounding soil readings suggest a great diversity of nutrients used to compose the ground here and points to a planet containing a myriad of environments that housed diverse plant, animal and fungi life. One of the better preserved walls of the building revel the drawing of a cornucopia, and it seems that this was food growing and collection center in a distant past. Further analysis shows that this was the epicenter of total ecological collapse of the planet's biosphere, due to predatory harvesting practices."
    #Stage 2 - Helios Tower
    pw_archaeology.110.name: "Exhausted Tower"
    pw_archaeology.110.desc: "The second ruined location appears to be a grand solar structure of some sort, that used to consist of a heliostat with several mirror arrays pointing to a central spire that converted the captured solar energy to another form, which we could not determine. The entire structure seem to have been able to float freely following the star's zenith to maximize energy intake, but has crashed a long time ago from lack of maintenance. In proximity to the crash site, our archeologists have found the control facility of this wonderful structure, which contains records telling how the original builders were able to manipulate the atmosphere of [From.Planet.GetName], to clear the clouds for the heliostat and exploit the rain in hydropower reservoirs. The constant seeding and voiding of clouds has shredded the atmosphere of the planet to the point of catastrophe."
    #Stage 3 - Erebus Project
    pw_archaeology.115.name: "Drained Rock"
    pw_archaeology.115.desc: "The third ruin is the entrance of a gigantic mining project that permeates the entire surface of [From.Planet.GetName]. Old machinery and tools here indicate a massive scale prospecting and extraction enterprise of valuable minerals of many types and uses. Unfortunately, the archaeological team also found several reports of soil erosion and land degradation caused by this excavation, and evidence that those reports were solemnly ignored; the final nail on this planets coffin.\n\nAll is not lost, however, with the data we have collected from these sites, and the employment of our own technology and resources, the science team here is fairly confident they can bring this planet back to its verdant glory, using the established infrastructure. Firstly we must revert the erosion processes and bring nutrients back to the ground by utilizing our own minerals."
    pw_archaeology.115.a: "Use the minerals, start the renewal process."
    #Stage 4 - Fixed planet surface
    pw_archaeology.120.name: "A Ground to Walk Upon"
    pw_archaeology.120.desc: "By adapting some of the old digging machines we could rebuild the soil components and mend the earth "
