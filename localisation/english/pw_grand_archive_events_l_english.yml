These chamber are designed as hexagons connected to each other like a beehive, and spawning several floors filled with shelves. Now we only need to fill them with what we find."

There will be forever work ofr the archivist here as new texts are continuously produced, but they have enough to boast complete collections of lost works and find hidden secrets in the writings.\n\nAn interesting idea for future proofing was pitched, but disregarded: have a section of the library containing every possible book that can be written preemptively, by including every possible combination of letters and spaces those books could hold. This was deemed too much work to hold too much gibberish, but remained in the annals as curiosity - and an idea for the future."
