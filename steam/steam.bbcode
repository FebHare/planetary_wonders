[h2]Compatible with Stellaris: 2.8.*[/h2]

This mod adds new buildings called [b]Planetary Wonders[/b].
The Wonders take up a district slot and take a considerable amount of resources and time to build, but provide a lot of jobs and bonuses to the planet.
Only one Planetary Wonder can be built per planet, unless our Ambition allows for more (see the added Ambition).
Even with the ambition, every Wonder is planet-unique, and some have further restrictions, even empire-unique. No Wonder can be built in habitats.

Right now there are 12 Wonders implemented but many more planned!
I want to give special attention to flavor and balance, so any input to keep the numbers reasonable is welcome.
